Code base to basically decrease the waiting time at the canteens across campus without any delivery personnel. We tend to order the food and wait for 15-20 minutes which is a sheer waste of time especially for the IIIT geeks. So, here comes the online ordering interface dedicated to the students of IIITH encompassing features such as 
•	online ordering
•	preparation time estimation
•	 token number
•	 food availability information 
•	online payment interface 
Peers will have to collect the food themselves once it is prepared but they will get an estimate of how much time it will take to prepare the order.
