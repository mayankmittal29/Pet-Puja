# 🍽️ PetPuja-Codebase

## Introduction
Welcome to the **PetPuja** codebase! This website is designed for college canteens, allowing students to place orders from their hostel rooms or libraries and collect them themselves, similar to Swiggy and Zomato but without delivery personnel. Payments are made at the time of ordering to facilitate vendors.

## ✨ Functionalities

- **Order Food:** 
  - Log in and navigate to the "Order Now" page.
  - Select a canteen to view available food items.
  - Choose quantities, pay for the order, and receive a token number.
  - Collect the order using the token number once the food is ready.
- **Estimated Preparation Time:** 
  - Displays estimated preparation time for made-to-order items (e.g., dosa) vs. pre-prepared items (e.g., samosa).

### 🍲 Canteen Admin Features
